        "description": "Start raising awareness of the various risks associated with AI-powered solutions.",
        "importance": "Acknowledging AI risk is foundational. Without this step, teams often move too quickly into experimentation without safeguards. Raising awareness helps organizations shift from assuming AI is just another automation tool to recognizing its potential for bias, misuse, privacy violations, or unintended consequences. This awareness also creates shared language and urgency across IT, business, and compliance teams.",
        "guidance": "Run an internal awareness campaign tailored to your organization's AI footprint. Include examples of risks across different tools — such as bias in model outcomes (AI Builder), hallucinations in Copilot responses (M365 Copilot), or improper data use. Use Microsoft’s Responsible AI Principles as a framework for discussion. Start with this resource: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/responsible-ai.

        "description": "Start to build up a team of AI advocates — power users, managers, and executives who understand responsible AI and help shape how it's applied.",
        "importance": "A named advocate signals intent. It gives AI risk and ethics a seat at the table — someone who champions responsible practices, raises concerns, and connects teams across data, IT, and business units. This early leadership role is especially important in decentralized environments like the Power Platform, where solutions often originate outside traditional IT.",
        "guidance": "Define an advocate role within your AI or Power Platform Center of Excellence (CoE). Ensure they have visibility of AI use cases across the business and understand Microsoft’s Responsible AI principles. They don’t need to be technical — they need to be respected, curious, and connected. For example governance structures and monitoring practices, see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/ai/responsible-ai-monitoring. You can also introduce your advocate to Microsoft’s Responsible AI resource hub: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai."

        "score": 80,
        "description": "Start training teams in bias — how it appears in AI systems, how it affects outcomes, and what we can do about it.",
        "importance": "Bias isn’t just a data problem — it can emerge at any point: in how problems are framed, which examples are used in training, or how outputs are interpreted. Bias awareness helps teams spot risks before models or prompts go live, especially in areas like AI Builder form processing, Copilot summaries, or Power Virtual Agents. It builds critical thinking and shifts the conversation from 'Is it working?' to 'Is it working fairly?'",
        "guidance": "Run short sessions using real-world examples from your organization — both custom models and low-code scenarios. Focus on where bias hides in language, decision-making, or training sets. Microsoft Learn has a great starter module that covers key principles: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/embrace-responsible-ai-principles-practices/. For deeper sessions, consider bringing in your advocate or ethics lead to help tailor the content."

        "score": 50,
        "description": "Pinpointing a real use case creates a focus for learning, applying responsible AI practices, and improving adoption maturity.",
        "importance": "Responsible AI becomes real when applied to specific scenarios. By identifying one live or planned use case — whether it’s a Copilot agent, an AI Builder form processor, or a custom model — teams can begin assessing risk, defining expected outcomes, and applying governance in context. It also helps to reveal gaps in data, process, or accountability before scaling.",
        "guidance": "Use Microsoft’s Responsible AI Evaluation Template to guide initial analysis: https://aka.ms/raievaluationtemplate. Focus on intended purpose, potential impact, and who is affected by the outputs. This helps initiate a repeatable process and makes abstract principles tangible. Start small — the goal is to learn through application, not perfection."

        "description": "Ensuring that AI decisions are explainable builds trust, transparency, and accountability — especially when AI is supporting real-world decisions.",
        "importance": "When users can't understand how AI came to a conclusion — whether it's a Copilot suggestion, a document classification, or a customer-facing chatbot — trust erodes. Explainability is essential for compliance, debugging, and user adoption. It also helps detect hidden bias or logic errors that might otherwise go unnoticed.",
        "guidance": "For custom models, use tools like SHAP or LIME to explain predictions and visualize feature importance. For low-code AI tools, ensure that decisions are traceable — document AI Builder models, prompt design in Copilot Studio, and decision logic in flows. For explainability guidance, see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai#transparency"

        "importance": "AI risk checklists help teams avoid blind spots by introducing consistency across projects. Whether building with AI Builder, Copilot Studio, or custom models, a checklist ensures the same types of questions are asked — about fairness, privacy, explainability, and safety. It also makes it easier to onboard new projects and hold teams accountable to shared standards.",
        "guidance": "Start by adapting Microsoft’s Responsible AI Impact Assessment Template to create a lightweight checklist tailored to your organization.

Identifying these features allows teams to handle them appropriately, either by excluding them from training, using them to evaluate fairness, or applying mitigation strategies. Without this step, bias can go undetected or be amplified.",
        "guidance": "Make it part of your AI project setup to label sensitive features and assess how they are used. For Power Platform solutions, consider how these attributes may appear in structured fields, prompts, or form inputs. Refer to Microsoft's guidance on data privacy and compliance: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/wp-compliance-data-privacy"

This practice builds accountability and exposes risks that may not be obvious in overall accuracy.",
        "guidance": "Run fairness audits periodically. For custom models, use Fairlearn to compare model outcomes across sensitive groups: https://fairlearn.org.
